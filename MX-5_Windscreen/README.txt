# Summary

Part is a replacement for those small round screw caps on the windscreen cowl that seem to have a nasty habit of disappearing or getting damaged over the life of a vehicle. Should fit NA and NB models.

It shouldn't need as much force to install as the originals, and is equipped with a small notch to allow for easier removal by DIY orangutans. 

Print instructions:

ABS
Align flat base to print bed
Keep your layers small (it prints quick, crank up the quality)
